being done as a regrade.


DISCUSSION
This is a good use of OOP because for one we are using the class structure in making the Process class. Also the way that this is coded makes it easily reusable.

Overloading the destructor if that is possible would be a good way and take input from the user at some point to determine which destructor to use. If overloading destructors is not possible then maybe having a global variable in the class that could be set to a specific value and is used in the destructor which holds a switch case of all 3 options.

Somehow during the destruction of a child process have it send a signal to the parent to let it know that it is about to die and then proceed with terminating the child process.

I did not do any of the extra credit.
